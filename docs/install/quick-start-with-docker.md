Use this guide to start MC-WEB-CONOLE  using the docker. This guide explains on the premise that all prerequisites have been met.

### Prequisites

- Ubuntu (22.04 is tested) with external access (https-443, http-80, ssh-ANY)
- pre-installed [MC-IAM-MANAGER](https://github.com/m-cmp/mc-iam-manager) and [MC-INFRA-MANAGER](https://github.com/m-cmp/mc-infra-manager)
    - Both should be completed setting (users, pre-Runscript, credential ….)
- Stop or Disable Services using 3001 port for web interface

### Step one : Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m-cmp/mc-web-console <YourFolderName>
```

### Step two : Go to Scripts Folder

```bash
cd <YourFolderName>/scripts
```

### Step three: **Modifying an Environment variable in docker-compose file**

Those marked with OPTIONAL do not have to be changed. Those marked with REQUIRED are fixed values that must be changed or used after setting.

```docker
version: '3.8'

services:
  mcwebconsole:
    build: ../
    container_name: mcwebconsole
    depends_on:
      - postgresdb
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "3001:3001"
    environment:
      GO_ENV: development # production | development # Please CHANGE ME (OPTIONAL)
      GODEBUG: netdns=go
      MCIAMMANAGER: https://sample.mc-iam-manager.com:5000 # Please CHANGE ME (REQUIRE)
      MCINFRAMANAGER: http://sample.m-cmp.com:1323/tumblebug # Please CHANGE ME (REQUIRE)
      API_USERNAME: API_USERNAME # Please CHANGE ME (REQUIRE)
      API_PASSWORD: API_PASSWORD # Please CHANGE ME (REQUIRE)
      DEV_DATABASE_URL: postgres://mcwebadmin:mcwebadminpassword@mcwebconsole-postgresdb:5432/mcwebconsoledbdev # Please CHANGE ME (OPTIONAL)
      PROD_DATABASE_URL: postgres://mcwebadmin:mcwebadminpassword@mcwebconsole-postgresdb:5432/mcwebconsoledbprod # Please CHANGE ME (OPTIONAL)
    restart: always
    networks:
      - mcwebconsole

  mcwebconsole-postgresdb:
    image: postgres:14-alpine
    container_name: mcwebconsole-postgresdb
    volumes:
      - ~/.m-cmp/mc-web-console/postgresql/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: mcwebconsoledbdev # [mcwebconsoledbdev / mcwebconsoledbprod] # Please CHANGE ME (OPTIONAL)
      POSTGRES_USER: mcwebadmin # Please CHANGE ME (OPTIONAL)
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mcwebadminpassword # Please CHANGE ME (OPTIONAL)
    networks:
      - mcwebconsole

networks:
  mcwebconsole:

```

### Step four: Excute docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

If you check the log as below, it seems that you have successfully built and deployed the mc-web-console without any problems.

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build -d
## This warning sign is a natural occurrence when running an existing MCIAMMANAGER with docker components.
WARNING: Found orphan containers (mciammanager, mciammanager-keycloak, mciammanager-nginx, mciammanager-certbot) for this project. If you removed or renamed this service in your compose file, you can run this command with the --remove-orphans flag to clean it up.
